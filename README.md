# FrauDTect AI - Fraud Detection & Threat Intelligence Tool

## Overview
FrauDTect is a real-time scam detection tool designed to analyze text, URLs, and screenshots using OCR, NLP, and a weighted keyword risk engine to flag high-risk content (e.g., ‚Äúdigital arrest‚Äù = critical) with automated scoring. The tool integrates OSINT and digital forensic features like WHOIS lookups, urlscan.io, and VirusTotal API to enhance scam detection with domain reputation and behavioral analysis.

## Technologies
- Python  
- Streamlit  
- OCR (Optical Character Recognition)
