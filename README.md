## 🚀 Features

### 📝 Text & Screenshot Analysis
- Weighted scam keyword detection  
- TF-IDF + Logistic Regression classifier  
- Hybrid risk scoring engine  
- Confidence score calculation  
- Scam category detection (crypto, bank fraud, urgency, phishing, etc.)  
- Structured AI-generated explanation of verdict  

### 🌐 URL Analysis
- Domain normalization  
- DNS resolution validation  
- Suspicious TLD detection  
- Domain age via WHOIS lookup  
- Optional deep OSINT scan:
  - VirusTotal API integration  
  - URLScan API integration  
- Risk scoring with explanation  

### 📊 Explainability Engine
- Extracts top influential ML features  
- Generates human-readable reasoning summary  
- Combines ML probability + keyword signals  

---

## 🧠 Architecture Overview

Hybrid Decision Model:
Final Risk Score = 0.6 × ML Probability + 0.4 × (Keyword Weighted Score × 5)


This ensures:
- Statistical robustness (ML)  
- Deterministic red-flag detection (rules)  
- Reduced false positives
